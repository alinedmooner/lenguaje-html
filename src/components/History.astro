    HTML has a rich history that began with its creation in the early 1990s and
    continued to evolve throughout the following decade. Let's take a journey
    through the history of HTML from its inception to the year 2000:
  </p>

  <h2>Creation of HTML 1990</h2>

  <p>
    HTML was conceived by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, in
    1990 while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research). He
    developed HTML as a way to share and structure scientific information among
    researchers. The first version, HTML 1.0, was a simple markup language with
    limited capabilities.
  </p>

  <h2>HTML 2.0 1995</h2>

  <p>
    HTML 2.0, released in 1995, introduced several important features, including
    support for tables and image embedding. This version standardized the basic
    elements and structure of web pages, paving the way for more complex
    layouts.
  </p>

  <h2>HTML 3.2 1997</h2>

  <p>
    HTML 3.2 was a significant milestone in HTML's history. It introduced
    support for advanced features like frames, which enabled the division of a
    web page into multiple sections. Additionally, this version brought enhanced
    form controls, allowing user input and interactivity.
  </p>

  <h2>Emergence of Web Browsers</h2>

  <p>
    During the 1990s, various web browsers emerged, each adding their own
    extensions and features to HTML. Browsers such as Mosaic, Netscape
    Navigator, and Internet Explorer played a crucial role in popularizing the
    World Wide Web and driving HTML's adoption.
  </p>

  <h2>HTML 4.0 and 4.01 1997-1999</h2>
  <p>
    HTML 4.0, released in 1997, introduced numerous new features and elements to
    enhance web page design and interactivity. It included support for style
    sheets, allowing developers to control the presentation of their web pages.
    HTML 4.0 also introduced support for scripting languages like JavaScript.
  </p>

  <h2>W3C Standardization</h2>
  <p>
    The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) played a pivotal role in HTML's
    standardization. The W3C, led by Tim Berners-Lee, worked to develop and
    maintain HTML specifications, ensuring interoperability among browsers and
    consistency in web development practices.
  </p>

  <h2>HTML 4.01 Transitional and Strict</h2>
  <p>
    HTML 4.01, released in 1999, had two versions: Transitional and Strict.
    Transitional allowed the use of older HTML elements and deprecated features,
    while Strict encouraged adherence to a cleaner, more standardized version of
    HTML. This version also introduced support for cascading style sheets (CSS)
    for enhanced visual control.
  </p>

  <h2>Web Accessibility and HTML</h2>
  <p>
    During this period, the importance of web accessibility grew. Developers and
    organizations began focusing on creating HTML content that could be easily
    accessed by individuals with disabilities, leading to guidelines and
    standards for accessible web design.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the year 2000, HTML had become a fundamental technology for creating web
    pages. Its evolution from a basic markup language to a more robust and
    feature-rich standard paved the way for the modern web development
    landscape.
